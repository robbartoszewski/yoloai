## Credential Management

API keys are injected via **file-based credential injection** following OWASP and CIS Docker Benchmark guidance (never pass secrets as environment variables to `docker run`):

1. yoloAI writes the API key(s) to temporary file(s) on the host. The agent definition specifies which env vars to inject (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude, `CODEX_API_KEY` for Codex).
2. Each key file is bind-mounted read-only into the container at `/run/secrets/<key_name>`.
3. The container entrypoint reads the file(s), exports the appropriate env var(s) (since CLI agents expect credentials as env vars), then launches the agent.
4. The host-side temp file is cleaned up immediately after container start.

That covers the **agent's own** credential, which yoloAI takes from its own environment. A **user's own** secrets — a registry token, a database password — arrive through a flag, and the flag to use is `--env-file <path>` (or `--env-file -` for stdin), on `new`, `run`, `start`, `restart` and `reset`. `--env KEY=VAL` puts the value on yoloai's command line, where another local account can usually read it with `ps -ww`, and re-exposes it on every `start`; `--env-file` puts only the path there. The same applies to the config `env:` key and to a profile's: both are files that stay files, and a safe bug report redacts a config value only when its *key name* reads as sensitive, so a secret under an ordinary name is published ([DF237](findings-unresolved.md)). Prefer `--env-file` to `env:` for anything secret. User-facing detail: [GUIDE.md § Passing secrets to the sandbox](../../GUIDE.md#passing-secrets-to-the-sandbox).

**What this protects against:** `docker inspect` does not show the key. `docker commit` does not capture it. `docker logs` does not leak it. No temp file lingers on host disk. Image layers never contain the key.

**Accepted tradeoff:** The agent process has the API key in its environment (unavoidable — CLI agents read credentials from env vars). `/proc/<pid>/environ` exposes it to same-user processes inside the container. This is acceptable because the agent already has full use of the key.

The user sets the appropriate API key in their host shell profile (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude, `CODEX_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` for Codex). yoloAI reads the required key(s) from the host environment at sandbox creation time based on the agent definition.

**Future directions:** Credential proxy (the MITM approach used by Docker Sandboxes) could provide stronger isolation by keeping the API key entirely outside the container. If CLI agents add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_FILE` support, the env var export step can be eliminated. macOS Keychain integration (cco's approach) could serve as an alternative credential source. These are deferred to future versions.

**Industry expectations:** yoloAI's file-based injection follows OWASP and CIS guidance and matches what Docker official images (MySQL, Postgres) and most competitors (deva.sh, cco) use. Key gaps vs. enterprise expectations:
- **Credential rotation/expiry:** Not supported. Most users use long-lived API keys. Not a v1 blocker, but enterprise users expect time-scoped credentials.
- **Vault integration:** HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager are expected in enterprise tooling. Deferred.
- **OAuth/SSO:** Claude supports OAuth for Pro/Max/Team plans. v1 supports API key auth only. Docker Sandboxes supports OAuth but reports it as broken (docker/for-mac#7842).
- **Assessment:** File-based injection is the industry standard for developer tools at this level. Credential proxy and vault integration are enterprise features for future versions.

## Seatbelt Backend Security

The seatbelt (macOS sandbox-exec) backend applies **default-deny credential access**:

- **Environment whitelist:** Only safe OS and locale variables (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `SHELL`, `TERM`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, etc.) are passed to the sandboxed process. Sensitive variables like `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and API keys are excluded. Agent API keys are injected by the entrypoint from the secrets directory.
- **Restricted home directory:** The SBPL profile grants read access only to `~/.local/` (agent binaries), `~/.gitconfig`, and `~/.config/git/` (git identity/settings) — not the entire home directory. This prevents the agent from reading `~/.ssh/`, `~/.gnupg/`, `~/.aws/`, `~/.git-credentials`, `~/.npmrc`, etc.
- **Opting in to credential access:** Users who need SSH agent forwarding or other credentials can add them via the config `env:` section (e.g., `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) which flows through the secrets mechanism — for a *value* that is itself secret, `--env-file` is the route rather than `env:`, since a config file stays a file and a bug report publishes a value whose key name does not read as sensitive (above) — or via `directories:` for directory access (e.g., `{path: ~/.ssh, mode: ro}`). `directories:` replaced `mounts:` in [D142](../decisions/working-notes.md) and additionally carries the aux-dir guards `mounts:` had none of: dangerous-path refusal, path-overlap and duplicate-mount detection, and the dirty-repo gate. Note the dangerous-path list is `$HOME`, `/`, and system directories (`internal/workspace/safety.go:12-24`) — **`~/.ssh` is not on it**, so mounting it is still permitted without `:force`. The advice above stands on its own: forward the agent socket rather than the key material.

## gVisor Security Mode

gVisor provides **syscall-level sandboxing** by intercepting and filtering system calls through a user-space kernel (the "Sentry"). This adds defense-in-depth beyond container isolation.

### Permission Requirements

Host-side bind-mounted paths use the **same restrictive permissions for every isolation mode** (directories: 0750, files: 0600; secrets dir/files: 0700/0600). gVisor does *not* require relaxed/world-readable permissions: the container process runs as the **invoking host UID** (`store.ContainerUser` returns that UID for `container-enhanced`, the same UID that owns the staged paths), and gVisor enforces guest-side uid/mode faithfully against the host-mapped owner. Owner-only perms therefore both grant the sandbox access and deny every other local user.

```bash
# All isolation modes (standard Docker and gVisor alike)
drwxr-x--- logs/           # 0750: owner + group only
-rw------- sandbox.jsonl   # 0600: owner only
```

This was empirically validated on a real Linux + gVisor host — see resolved finding **DF20** (`docs/contributors/design/findings-resolved.md`). An earlier design assumed gVisor's UID remapping forced world-readable bits (0777/0666); that assumption was wrong and had made staged credentials world-readable in `/tmp` on multi-tenant hosts.

**Affected paths** (inside `~/.yoloai/sandboxes/<name>/`):
- Container-writable directories: `logs/`, `work/`, `agent-runtime/`, `files/`, `cache/`
- Log files: `sandbox.jsonl`, `monitor.jsonl`, `agent-hooks.jsonl`
- Status files: `agent-status.json`
- Temporary secrets directory (exists only during container startup, removed within seconds; 0700 dir / 0600 files)

**Host-only directories** (not bind-mounted) always use restrictive 0750 permissions: `home-seed/`, `bin/`, `tmux/`, `backend/`.

### Security Trade-offs

**What this means for security:** all users benefit from principle of least privilege (0750/0600) regardless of isolation mode — sandbox files are not readable by other users on the host. gVisor users additionally gain syscall-level sandboxing inside the container that standard Docker lacks, at no cost to host-side file permission tightness. The sandbox directory (`~/.yoloai/sandboxes/<name>/`) is also created 0750.

**Inside the container:** the container process runs as the host UID and sees itself as the owner of the bind-mounted paths; permissions are uniform across backends.

### macOS + gVisor Compatibility

**gVisor is blocked on macOS** due to a known bug where Claude Code hangs indefinitely during initialization (infinite `epoll_pwait` loop). This appears to be a gVisor ARM64 syscall emulation issue. Tracked at: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/35454

Workarounds for macOS users who want additional sandboxing:
- Use standard Docker security (default)
- Use Seatbelt backend: `--backend seatbelt` (macOS-only, lightweight sandboxing via `sandbox-exec`)

gVisor works correctly on Linux (both x86_64 and ARM64).

## Security Considerations

- **The agent runs arbitrary code** inside the container: shell commands, file operations, network requests. The container provides isolation, not prevention.
- **All directories are read-only by default.** You explicitly opt in to write access per directory via `:rw` (live) or `:copy` (staged).
- **`:copy` directories** protect your originals. Changes only land when you explicitly `yoloai apply`.
- **`:rw` directories** give the agent direct read/write access. Use only when you've committed your work or don't mind destructive changes. The tool warns if it detects uncommitted git changes.
- **API key exposure:** The agent's API key (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude, `GEMINI_API_KEY` for Gemini) is injected via file-based credential injection (bind-mounted at `/run/secrets/`, read by entrypoint, host file cleaned up immediately). This hides the key from `docker inspect`, `docker commit`, and `docker logs`. The key is still present in the agent process's environment (unavoidable — CLI agents expect env vars). Use scoped API keys with spending limits where possible. See [Security Research](research/security.md) "Credential Management for Docker Containers" for the full analysis of approaches and tradeoffs.
- **SSH keys:** If you mount `~/.ssh` into the container (even read-only), the agent can read private keys. Prefer SSH agent forwarding: add `${SSH_AUTH_SOCK}:${SSH_AUTH_SOCK}:ro` to `mounts` and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK: ${SSH_AUTH_SOCK}` to `env` in config. This passes the socket without exposing key material.
- **Network access** is unrestricted by default (required for agent API calls). The agent can download binaries, connect to external services, or exfiltrate code. Use `--network-isolated` to restrict traffic to the agent's required API domains, `--network-allow <domain>` for finer control, or `--network-none` for full isolation.
- **Network isolation implementation:** `--network-isolated` uses iptables + ipset inside the container, following the same pattern as Anthropic's own Claude Code devcontainer and Trail of Bits' devcontainer (both verified production implementations). **See [Network Isolation](network-isolation.md) for the planned redesign that moves enforcement to the host netns and unifies behavior across all Linux backends; the description below documents the currently implemented in-sandbox approach.**
  1. **iptables + ipset rules:** The entrypoint resolves allowlisted domains to IPs via `dig`, populates an ipset (`hash:net`), and sets default-deny iptables policy. Only traffic to allowlisted IPs is permitted. Requires `CAP_NET_ADMIN` (a separate capability from `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` — both must be granted when using `:overlay` + `--network-isolated`; for `:copy` mode, only `CAP_NET_ADMIN` is added). The entrypoint configures rules while running as root, then drops privileges via `gosu` — the agent never has `CAP_NET_ADMIN`.
  2. **Per-agent allowlist:** Each agent definition includes required domains (e.g., `api.anthropic.com` for Claude). `--network-allow <domain>` adds user-specified domains. The combined allowlist is stored in `netpolicy.json` for container recreation.
  3. **Single container:** No proxy sidecar, no internal Docker network. Simple, debuggable, same approach that Anthropic ships.

  **Multi-backend:** Docker uses iptables+ipset as described. Seatbelt can restrict network access via sandbox profile rules (binary allow/deny per host, or full `--network-none`). Tart VMs would need VM-level network configuration (deferred — Tart network isolation is not yet designed).

  Known limitations: DNS exfiltration remains possible — UDP 53 must be allowed for domain resolution (same limitation as Anthropic's devcontainer and Trail of Bits'). Domain-to-IP resolution happens at container start; CDN IP rotation can make rules stale (restart to refresh). Domain fronting remains theoretically possible on CDNs that haven't disabled it. These limitations are shared by all iptables-based implementations. See [Security Research](research/security.md) "Network Isolation Research" for detailed analysis of bypass vectors.

  **[DEFERRED] Proxy sidecar architecture:** A more robust approach using an internal Docker network + proxy sidecar container + DNS control could mitigate DNS exfiltration and handle CDN IP rotation dynamically. This is well-researched (see [Security Research](research/security.md)) but adds significant operational complexity (sidecar lifecycle management across all commands, proxy image building, health checks, failure modes). The iptables-only approach covers the primary threat vectors at a fraction of the complexity. The proxy architecture remains documented in [Security Research](research/security.md) if stronger isolation is ever needed.
- **Runs as non-root** inside the container (user `yoloai` matching host UID/GID). Claude Code requires this (refuses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as root); Codex runs non-root by convention.
- **`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability** is granted to the container when using `:overlay` mode. This is required for overlayfs mounts inside the container. It is a broad capability — it also permits other mount operations and namespace manipulation. The container's namespace isolation limits the blast radius, but this is a tradeoff: overlay gives instant setup and space efficiency at the cost of a wider capability grant. `:copy` mode avoids this capability entirely.
- **Dangerous directory detection:** The tool refuses to mount `$HOME`, `/`, macOS system directories (`/System`, `/Library`, `/Applications`), or Linux system directories (`/usr`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/boot`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`) unless `:force` is appended, preventing accidental exposure of your entire filesystem.
- **Privilege escalation via recipes:** The `setup` commands and `cap_add`/`devices` config fields enable significant privilege escalation. These are power-user features for advanced setups (e.g., Tailscale, GPU passthrough) but have no guardrails — a misconfigured recipe could undermine container isolation. Document risks clearly when these features are used.
